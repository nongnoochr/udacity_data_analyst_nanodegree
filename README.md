### Program Overview (From Udacity)

The Data Analyst Nanodegree program offers you the opportunity to master data skills that are in demand by top employers, such as Python and Statistics. By the end of the program you will have created a portfolio of work demonstrating your ability to solve complex data problems. After graduating, you will have the skills needed to join a large corporation or a small firm, or even go independent as a freelance data analyst.

Note that I took the Data Analyst Nanodegree program when it consisted of 2 terms.

Currently (As of 05/19/2019) - The program has been updated to only contain one term (See a syllabus of the updated program [here](./nd002-syllabus_2018-June_v9.pdf))
*(Note that I could not find the original syllabus anymore)*

A major difference between the old and updated courses is that the the old course
also provide classes to go over Python (numpy+pandas+matplotlib) and SQL in great details during Term 1 and I also did projects for them as well.

#### Term 1: 

##### Introduction to Python

Learn Python programming fundamentals such as data types and structures, variables, loops, and functions.

##### Introduction to Data Analysis

Learn the data analysis process of questioning, wrangling, exploring, analyzing, and communicating data. Learn how to work with data in Python using libraries like NumPy and Pandas.

##### Practical Statistics

Learn how to apply inferential statistics and probability to important, real-world scenarios, such as analyzing A/B tests and building supervised learning models.

#### Term 2: 

##### Exploratory Data Analysis

Learn to explore data at multiple levels using appropriate visualizations, acquire statistical knowledge for summarizing data, and develop intuition around a data set.

##### Data Wrangling

Learn the data wrangling process of gathering, assessing, and cleaning data. Learn how to use Python to wrangle data programmatically and prepare it for deeper analysis.

##### Data Story Telling

Learn to apply sound design and data visualization principles to the data analysis process. Learn how to use analysis and visualizations to tell a story with data.

## Project Descriptions<a name="projectdescriptions"></a>

### Term 1: 

#### Welcome to Term 1!

[Project: Exploring Weather Trends](./Project_Exploring_Weather_Trends/Project_Exploring_Weather_Trends.pdf)

Exploring Weather Trends - Project Instructions
Summary
In this project, you will analyze local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends where you live to overall global temperature trends.

#### Introduction to Python

[Project: Explore US Bikeshare Data](./Project_Explore_US_Bikeshare_Data/Bike_Share_Analysis.ipynb)

In this project, you will make use of Python to explore data related to bikeshare systems for three major bikeshare systems in the United States. You will perform data wrangling to unify the format of data from the three systems and write code to compute descriptive statistics. You will also make use of a package that is not part of the standard Python library to help you visualize the data.

#### Introduction to Data Analysis

[Project: Investigating a Dataset](./Project_Investigate_a_Dataset/Investigate_a_Dataset.ipynb)

In this project, you'll go through the data analysis process and see how everything fits together. Later Nanodegree projects will focus on individual pieces of the data analysis process.

You'll use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib, which make writing data analysis code in Python a lot easier! Not only that, these are sought-after skills by employers!

#### Practical Statistics

[Project: Analyze A/B Test Results](./Project_Analyze_AB_Test_Results/Analyze_ab_test_results_notebook.ipynb)

A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists. It is important that you get some practice working with the difficulties of these.

For this project, you will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. Your goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

### Term 2: 

#### Welcome to Term 2

[Project: Test a Perceptual Phenomenon](./Project_Test_Perceptual_Phenomenon/Test_Perceptual_Phenomenon.ipynb)

In this project, you will investigate a classic phenomenon from experimental psychology called the Stroop Effect. You will learn a little bit about the experiment, create a hypothesis regarding the outcome of the task, then go through the task yourself. You will then look at some data collected from others who have performed the same task and will compute some statistics describing the results. Finally, you will interpret your results in terms of your hypotheses.


#### Exploratory Data Analysis

[Project: Explore and Summarize Data](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nongnoochr/udacity_data_analyst_nanodegree/master/Project_Explore_and_Summarize_Data/Analysis_of_ProposeLoanData.html?token=ADY55V7IMMBL2VBNACYWBOC44AY5K)

In this project, you will use R and apply exploratory data analysis techniques to explore relationships in one variable to multiple variables and to explore a selected data set for distributions, outliers, and anomalies.

#### Data Wrangling

[Project: Wrangle and Analyze Data](./Project_Wrangle_and_Analyze_Data/wrangle_act.ipynb)


Real-world data rarely comes clean. Using Python and its libraries, you will gather data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it. This is called data wrangling. You will document your wrangling efforts in a Jupyter Notebook, plus showcase them through analyses and visualizations using Python (and its libraries) and/or SQL.

The dataset that you will be wrangling (and analyzing and visualizing) is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because "they're good dogs Brent." WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.

WeRateDogs downloaded their Twitter archive and sent it to Udacity via email exclusively for you to use in this project. This archive contains basic tweet data (tweet ID, timestamp, text, etc.) for all 5000+ of their tweets as they stood on August 1, 2017. More on this soon.

#### Data Story Telling

[Project: Create a Tableau Story](./Project_Create_Tableau_Story/reportout.pdf)

For this project, you will create a data visualization using Tableau that tells a story or highlights trends or patterns in a data set. Your work should be a reflection of the theory and practice of data visualization, such as visual encodings, design principles, and effective communication.
