### Program Overview (From Udacity)

The Data Analyst Nanodegree program offers you the opportunity to master data skills that are in demand by top employers, such as Python and Statistics. By the end of the program you will have created a portfolio of work demonstrating your ability to solve complex data problems. After graduating, you will have the skills needed to join a large corporation or a small firm, or even go independent as a freelance data analyst.

Note that I took the Data Analyst Nanodegree program when it consisted of 2 terms.

Currently (As of 05/19/2019) - The program has been updated to only contain one term (See syllabus of the updated program [here](./nd002-syllabus_2018-June_v9.pdf))

A major difference between the old and updated courses is that the the old course
also provide classes to go over Python (numpy+pandas+matplotlib) and SQL in great details during Term 1 and I also did projects for them as well.

#### Term 1: 

##### Introduction to Python

Learn Python programming fundamentals such as data types and structures, variables, loops, and functions.

##### Introduction to Data Analysis

Learn the data analysis process of questioning, wrangling, exploring, analyzing, and communicating data. Learn how to work with data in Python using libraries like NumPy and Pandas.

##### Practical Statistics

Learn how to apply inferential statistics and probability to important, real-world scenarios, such as analyzing A/B tests and building supervised learning models.

#### Term 2: 

##### Exploratory Data Analysis

Learn to explore data at multiple levels using appropriate visualizations, acquire statistical knowledge for summarizing data, and develop intuition around a data set.

##### Data Wrangling

Learn the data wrangling process of gathering, assessing, and cleaning data. Learn how to use Python to wrangle data programmatically and prepare it for deeper analysis.

##### Data Story Telling

Learn to apply sound design and data visualization principles to the data analysis process. Learn how to use analysis and visualizations to tell a story with data.
